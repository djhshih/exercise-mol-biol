# Exercises for Molecular Biology

## Scenario A

A ovarian cancer sample (100 mg) was homogenized in 1 mL of TRIZOL reagent in a
1.5 mL tube. After adding 0.2 mL volume of chloroform, the tube was vortexed, 
incubated, and centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min.
A total of three phases are now visible in the tube.

1. Which phase contains the RNA? Which phase contain protein? Why?

2. How can RNA be extracted from here?

3. Describe the steps after RNA extraction to make a mRNA library for
   sequencing.


## Scenario B

Satoru Kyo, Masahiro Takakura, Takahiro Taira, Taro Kanaya, Hideaki Itoh, Masuo Yutsudo, Hiroyoshi Ariga, Masaki Inoue, Sp1 cooperates with c-Myc to activate transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT), Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 28, Issue 3, 1 February 2000, Pages 669â€“677, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/28.3.669

Explain how specific results in Satoru *et al.* 2000 answer the following
questions:

1. Is the E-box downstream of the TERT transcription start site required 
   for TERT transcription?
   What about the upstream E-box?

2. Is the downstream E-box sufficient for TERT transcription?

3. What is the minimal promoter region required for TERT transcription?

4. Design additional experiments to more definitely answer the above questions 
   for TERT transcription from its endogenous promoter in human cells.

5. Can Myc bind specifically to the upstream E-box and activate the TERT
   promoter as a homodimer?


## Scenario C

Design experiments to show that p53 regulates p21 in *TP53* wildtype glioblastoma. Collectively, the experiments must show that:

- TP53 binds to the promoter of p21
- TP53 binding to p21 promoter causes changes in expression
- Disruption of p53 disrupts p21 expression in glioblastoma


## Scenario D

Write a concise and clear 1-page protocol for thawing OVCAR-3 cells and to freeze additional vials of cells down. Include enough details of all required reagents, such as the medium, as well as specific pipetting volumes. Assume that we use T75 flask for passaging and 10 cm plates for harvest.
