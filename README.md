# Exercises for Molecular Biology

Submit your answers with the questions included as a PDF file (3 pages max).

## Scenario A

A ovarian cancer sample (100 mg) was homogenized in 1 mL of TRIZOL reagent in a
1.5 mL tube. After adding 0.2 mL volume of chloroform, the tube was vortexed, 
incubated, and centrifuged at 200g for 15 min.
You expect to see three phases in the tube.

1. Which phase contains the RNA? Which phase contain protein? Why?

2. How can RNA be extracted from here?


## Scenario B

Satoru Kyo, Masahiro Takakura, Takahiro Taira, Taro Kanaya, Hideaki Itoh, Masuo Yutsudo, Hiroyoshi Ariga, Masaki Inoue, Sp1 cooperates with c-Myc to activate transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT), Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 28, Issue 3, 1 February 2000, Pages 669â€“677, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/28.3.669

Explain how **specific results from figures** in Satoru *et al.* 2000 answer the following
questions:

1. Is the E-box downstream of the TERT transcription start site absolutely required 
   for TERT transcription?

2. Is the downstream E-box sufficient for TERT transcription?

3. What is the minimal promoter region required for TERT transcription?

4. Design additional experiments to more definitely answer the above questions 
   for TERT transcription from its endogenous promoter in human cells.

5. Can Myc bind specifically to the upstream E-box and activate the TERT
   promoter as a homodimer?


## Scenario C

Design experiments to show that p53 regulates p21 in *TP53* wildtype glioblastoma. Collectively, the experiments must show that:

- TP53 binds to the promoter of p21
- TP53 binding to p21 promoter causes changes in expression
- Disruption of p53 disrupts p21 expression in glioblastoma


## Scenario D

Write a clear and concise 1-page protocol for thawing OVCAR-3 cells and to freeze additional vials of cells down. Include enough details of all required reagents, such as the medium, as well as specific pipetting volumes. Assume that we use T75 flask for passaging and 10 cm plates for harvest.
